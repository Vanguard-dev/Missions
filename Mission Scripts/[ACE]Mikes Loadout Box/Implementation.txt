Explanation;

To create an actual loadout,

Go into the Virtual Arsenal, Create it in FULL. (including binos, Weapons, Ammo & Items.) & Radio

Then click "Export"

Paste it into one of the "Example" SQF Files. 

Then you need to change all the lines with "this" to "player"

Copy the "Gear" folder into your mission folder.

in the Editor, Place down the box you want to use as the "Loadout box"

Paste into the init field;


this allowdamage false; this enablesimulation false;  
this addAction ["Example Medic", "Gear\Example.sqf"]; 
this addAction ["Medic", "Gear\Medic.sqf"]; 
this addAction ["Explosive Specialist", "Gear\ES.sqf"]; 
this addAction ["Rifleman", "Gear\Rifleman.sqf"];

First line is to completely Prevent people Ramming/Destroying this box if it's necessary.
Second Line; "Example Medic" is what people will see the Action as, Second calls the Script which forces the Items on you.

The actual "Example.sqf" files can be changed to Medic, SquadLead, Sniper etc. It makes it easier for you to know what exactly it is you have.

When you paste from the Arsenal, You can shorten down the code to make it easier on yourself. 

Lines that begin with "Comment" can be deleted.

The line which sets the Identity can be deleted.


To go more in depth with minor changes, Remove the relevant lines of gear you don't want removed.

removeAllWeapons player; // Obvious, Removes all weapons
removeAllItems player; // Anything classed as an Item
removeAllAssignedItems player; // Radios, GPS, Map Etc
removeUniform player; // Uniform
removeVest player; // Vest
removeBackpack player; // Backpack
removeHeadgear player; // Headgear
removeGoggles player; // NVGs / Facewear


Last Note; If you have Grenades in a loadout, but you don't have any "Remove" lines that remove Grenades. If they take that loadout repeatedly (or select the wrong one)
They'll end up stockpiling grenades and it won't correct the normal uniform.

If you're forcing a full loadout this way, Just keep all the Remove lines.
